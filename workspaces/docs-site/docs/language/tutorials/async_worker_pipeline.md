# Build an asynchronous worker pipeline

This tutorial runs several independent jobs, preserves their typed results, and places an explicit deadline around slow work. It uses the task APIs `spawn`, `JoinHandle`, and `timeout` from the full standard-library Loaf shipped with Incan 0.5.

</ol>

## Step 1: Define a worker

Importing `std.async` activates Incan's async syntax and runtime support:

```incan
from std.async.task import spawn
from std.async.time import sleep, timeout

async def process_job(name: str, delay: float) -> str:
    println(f"starting {name}")
    await sleep(delay)
    return f"finished {name}"
```

Calling `process_job(...)` creates async work. `await` drives it directly; `spawn(...)` starts it as a concurrent task.

## Step 2: Spawn several jobs

```incan
async def main() -> None:
    first = spawn(process_job("orders", 0.20))  # (1)
    second = spawn(process_job("customers", 0.10))
    third = spawn(process_job("inventory", 0.15))

    show_result("orders", await first)  # (2)
    show_result("customers", await second)
    show_result("inventory", await third)
```

1. `spawn(...)` starts each future immediately and returns a typed `JoinHandle`; the three jobs can therefore overlap.
2. Awaiting a handle returns the task boundary's `Result`, which is passed to one explicit handler rather than discarded.

The jobs begin before the first handle is awaited, so their delays overlap. Awaiting a `JoinHandle[T]` returns `Result[T, TaskJoinError]`: task execution itself can fail independently of the value `T`.

## Step 3: Handle join results

```incan
from std.async.task import TaskJoinError

def show_result(name: str, result: Result[str, TaskJoinError]) -> None:
    match result:  # (1)
        case Ok(value): println(value)
        case Err(error): println(f"{name} failed: {error.message()}")
```

1. This `match` is intentional terminal handling: both outcomes produce a visible side effect, so a combinator chain would hide rather than simplify the decision.

Do not discard join failures in production paths. A spawned task is a separate failure boundary even when the worker's ordinary return value is infallible.

## Step 4: Add a deadline

Use `timeout(...)` when the underlying operation should be cancelled after the deadline:

```incan
async def bounded_job() -> None:
    match await timeout(0.05, process_job("slow", 0.50)):  # (1)
        case Ok(value): println(value)
        case Err(error): println(f"deadline reached: {error.message()}")
```

1. `timeout(...)` owns the cancellation policy. The final `match` reports the outcome at the program boundary; it is not sequential plumbing that should be replaced with `map` or `and_then`.

Use `timeout_join(...)` instead when already-spawned work must remain live after the caller's deadline. Its timeout outcome returns the live handle rather than silently cancelling durable work.

Build and run the repository example:

```bash
incan build examples/advanced/async_worker_pipeline.incn
incan run examples/advanced/async_worker_pipeline.incn
```

You ran independent work, preserved task failures as typed results, and bounded slow work with an explicit deadline. The normal command reused the toolchain's checked async closure; it did not invoke Cargo on the consumer path.
