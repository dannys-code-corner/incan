# Traits as language hooks (and overloading)

Traits let you describe **behavior contracts**: “a type supports X”.

Some common language features are easiest to understand as **desugaring** into trait methods. This is similar in spirit
to Rust using traits like `IntoIterator`, `Index`, and `Add` to power `for`, indexing, and operators.

This page explains the idea with one concrete example. For the authoritative reference pages, see:

- [Derives & traits (Reference)](../reference/derives_and_traits.md)
- [Stdlib traits: collection protocols](../reference/stdlib_traits/collection_protocols.md)
- [Stdlib traits: indexing and slicing](../reference/stdlib_traits/indexing_and_slicing.md)
- [Stdlib traits: callable objects](../reference/stdlib_traits/callable.md)
- [Stdlib traits: operators](../reference/stdlib_traits/operators.md)
- [Stdlib traits: conversions](../reference/stdlib_traits/conversions.md)

## Why this matters

This is the mental model behind “ergonomic syntax without magic”:

- You can use pleasant syntax (`x[i]`, `for x in y`, `a + b`) **without** baking special cases into the language.
- User-defined types can become “first-class citizens” by implementing the same hooks as built-in types.
- The compiler can typecheck these capabilities explicitly (Rust-like), instead of relying on runtime duck typing.

## What “language hooks” means

A **language hook** is a method name that the compiler can call implicitly when you use a piece of syntax.

Examples:

- `len(x)` can desugar to something like `x.__len__()`
- `xs[i]` can desugar to `xs.__getitem__(i)`
- `obj()` can desugar to `obj.__call__(...)`
- `a + b` can desugar to `a.__add__(b)`

The important idea is that the *syntax* stays simple, while the *behavior* is defined by traits.

## Example: indexing is a hook

When you write:

```incan
value = xs[i]
```

Think:

```incan
value = xs.__getitem__(i)
```

So if you want a custom type to support `[]`, you implement the indexing hook method (and the corresponding trait
requirements as defined in the stdlib trait docs):

```incan
model Grid:
    data: list[int]

    def __getitem__(self, idx: int) -> int:
        return self.data[idx]
```

Rust analogy: `xs[i]` is powered by `std::ops::Index`, but the idea is the same: syntax → a trait-defined hook.

## How this is Rust-like (not Python-magic)

In Python, “protocols” are often structural and dynamic (“if it quacks, it’s a duck”), and operator behavior is resolved
at runtime via dunder lookup.

In Incan, the intent is closer to Rust:

- **Static typing**: whether a type supports a hook is part of the type system.
- **Deterministic dispatch**: behavior is resolved at compile time (no dynamic MRO).
- **No runtime patching**: you can’t add behavior to types at runtime.

This is what keeps hook-based ergonomics predictable in large codebases.

## Overloading: what we mean (and what we don’t)

“Overloading” can mean different things:

- **Operator overloading**: `a + b` uses a hook like `__add__`.
- **Trait-based polymorphism**: generic code can accept “anything that implements Trait X”.

It does *not* necessarily mean “multiple functions with the same name and different signatures” (traditional overload sets).

In Incan, most extensibility is intended to flow through traits and explicit, checkable contracts.

## A concrete mental model

You can think of hook traits as giving user-defined types the same “surface ergonomics” that built-in types have.

For example, if a type can be indexed, you should be able to write `x[i]` without caring whether `x` is a built-in list
or a custom collection type.

That’s why the stdlib defines traits for:

- collection protocols (`len`, iteration, membership, truthiness)
- indexing and slicing (`[]`, `a:b:c`)
- callability (`obj()`)
- operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, etc.)
- conversions (`from`, `into`, `try_from`, `try_into`)
