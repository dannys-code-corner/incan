# Imports and modules

This page explains the mental model behind Incan modules and imports.

For details and tasks, use the split pages:

- How-to: [Imports and modules (how-to)](../how-to/imports_and_modules.md)
- Reference: [Imports and modules (reference)](../reference/imports_and_modules.md)

## Key ideas

- Incan supports two import styles (Python-style and Rust-style) that can be mixed freely.
- Modules are discovered from the filesystem — there is no explicit `mod` declaration step.
- Directories can act as modules; use `mod.incn` as the “main file” for a directory module when needed.
- Common types and functions are available without imports via the prelude (see the reference page for the full list).

!!! info "Coming from Python?"
    In Python, packages are driven by directory structure and `__init__.py`.  
    In Incan, directories are recognized automatically; you can use `mod.incn` when you need a directory/module
    entrypoint.

## How module discovery works (conceptual)

When you import a local module, the compiler:

1. Resolves the path (handling `.`, `..`, `super`, `crate`)
2. Finds the `.incn` file (or `mod.incn` for directories)
3. Parses and type-checks that file
4. Makes its types and functions available in the importing file

### Coming from Rust

In Rust, you typically need explicit module declarations before importing. In Incan, you generally “just import” and the
compiler discovers modules automatically.

### Coming from Python

In Python, packages are driven by directory structure and `__init__.py`. In Incan, directories are recognized as modules
without `__init__.py`; use `mod.incn` when you need a directory entrypoint.
