# Const bindings

`const` declares a **compile-time constant**: a name whose value is validated during compilation and can be baked into the
output program.

## Why is `const` a thing?

In Incan, `const` exists to make intent explicit and to unlock compiler guarantees:

- **Intent**: communicates “this never changes” to readers and tools.
- **Safety**: prevents accidental mutation/reassignment and enforces **deep immutability** for baked data.
- **Performance**: allows the compiler to bake data into the output (including `'static` backing data when needed).
- **Reproducibility**: keeps “configuration tables” and other fixed data out of runtime control flow.

!!! info "Coming from Python?"
    In Python, “constants” are mostly a convention (e.g. `MAX_RETRIES = 5`) and can still be reassigned at runtime.
    In Incan, `const` is a language feature with compile-time validation and immutability guarantees.

## How do I use it?

- **Syntax**: `const NAME [: Type] = <expr>`
- **Scope**: `const` is currently **module-level only** (see [RFC 008](../../RFCs/done/008_const_bindings.md))
- **Type annotations**: optional; if omitted, the compiler must be able to infer the type
- **Initializer rules**: the initializer must be **const-evaluable** (no runtime calls)

!!! tip "Rule of thumb"
    If you can’t evaluate the initializer without running the program (IO, time, function calls, loops), it doesn’t belong
    in a `const`.

## How is `const` different from a regular variable?

- **`const`**:
    - evaluated at compile time
    - cannot depend on runtime values or non-const variables
    - deeply immutable (no mutating APIs for baked strings/bytes/collections)
- **regular variables (`let` / bindings)**:
    - computed at runtime
    - can call functions, use loops, read inputs, etc.
    - may be mutable (`mut`) depending on the binding

!!! info "Coming from TS/JS?"
    In TypeScript/JavaScript, `const` mostly means “this binding can’t be reassigned” (the value can still be mutable),
    and it can be computed at runtime.

    In Incan, `const` means “compile-time constant”: the initializer must be const-evaluable, and the result is exposed as
    a read-only (frozen) value.

## What can a `const` initializer do?

*Allowed*:

- literals: `int`, `float`, `bool`, `str`, `bytes`
- simple unary/binary ops on const literals: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`, comparisons, boolean ops, string concatenation
- tuple/list/dict/set literals whose elements/keys/values are themselves const-evaluable
- references to other `const` bindings

*Disallowed*:

- function/method calls (including builtins)
- comprehensions, ranges, f-strings
- accessing non-const variables or runtime state

If the initializer is not const-evaluable, the compiler emits an error at the binding site.

## Why are there “Rust-native” vs “Frozen” consts?

Incan supports two const “families” because Rust’s `const` rules are strict *and* because Incan wants **deep immutability**
for baked data:

- **Rust-native consts**:
    - map directly to a Rust `const`
    - best for numbers, booleans, and tuples of those
- **Frozen consts**:
    - for data that should be baked into the program but exposed through a **read-only API**
    - includes strings/bytes and common containers (lists/dicts/sets)
    - represented using frozen stdlib wrappers like `FrozenStr`, `FrozenBytes`, `FrozenList[T]`, `FrozenDict[K, V]`,
      `FrozenSet[T]`
    - the compiler emits baked `'static` backing data and constructs frozen wrappers from it

Important detail: in `const` context, Incan treats `str`/`bytes` and common containers as **frozen** to preserve deep
immutability. In other words, `const` is not “just a `let` that runs earlier”.

!!! info "Coming from Rust?"
    This is similar to Rust’s split between “things that can be `const`” and “things that need `'static` backing data and
    a safe API”.

## Examples

### Rust-native consts

```incan
const MAX_RETRIES: int = 5
const TIMEOUT_SECS: float = 2.5
const IS_DEBUG: bool = False
const PORT = 8080  # type may be inferred
const GREETING = "hello" + " world"  # string concatenation is allowed
```

### Frozen consts (deeply immutable)

```incan
const GREETING: FrozenStr = "hello"
const NUMS: FrozenList[int] = [1, 2, 3]
const HEADERS: FrozenDict[FrozenStr, FrozenStr] = {"User-Agent": "incan"}
const DATA: FrozenBytes = b"\x00\x01"
```

### Consts can reference other consts

```incan
const BASE: int = 10
const LIMIT: int = BASE * 2
```

## Errors

- If the initializer is not const-evaluable (calls, comprehensions, ranges, f-strings, non-const variables).
- If a const dependency cycle exists (consts reference each other in a loop).
- If types do not match (explicit type annotation incompatible with the initializer).
