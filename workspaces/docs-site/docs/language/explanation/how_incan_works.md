# How Incan works

This page is a user-level mental model of what happens when you run Incan.

## The short version

Incan compiles `.incn` source code to Rust, then builds an executable.

## Pipeline (conceptual)

```

## What this means in practice

- Incan programs are compiled (not interpreted).
- The “happy path” is: edit code → run `incan` → get an executable or an error.
- When things fail, you typically care about which stage failed (parse, typecheck, codegen, build).

## Where to go next
