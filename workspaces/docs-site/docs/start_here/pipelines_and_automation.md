# Pipelines and automation

This route is for automation and data-tool builders who want typed boundaries, reproducible commands, and CI-friendly native artifacts.

  <strong>Keep explicit stages and repeatable commands. Move inputs, failures, and output contracts into types the compiler can check.</strong>

The [typed data processor](../language/tutorials/typed_data_processor.md) is the executable next step when your workflow reads typed JSON, validates records, and emits a report artifact.

## Install once

Follow [Getting Started](../tooling/tutorials/getting_started.md) for the current installer choices and canonical first-project commands.

## What transfers

- Staged transformations, explicit inputs and outputs, and repeatable operational boundaries
- Deterministic commands, exit codes, locked dependencies, and inspectable reports
- Modules, file I/O, typed errors, tests, and release artifacts

## What changes

- Each fallible boundary returns a typed value rather than relying on logs or ambient shell state.
- Data contracts and transformations can live in ordinary program modules with tests.
- A native executable becomes the repeatable automation unit.

## What not to expect

- SQL, dataframe, Spark, or notebook compatibility; classify relational query and plan work with the [Incan or IncQL? chooser](incan_or_incql.md)
- A remote package registry or hosted pipeline service
- Enterprise deployment policy beyond the documented lock, offline, report, and exit-code contracts
