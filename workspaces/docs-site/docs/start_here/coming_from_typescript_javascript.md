# Coming from TypeScript or JavaScript

This route is for TypeScript and JavaScript developers evaluating Incan for command-line tools, services, and typed application packages.

## Build a service or typed data tool

The [typed API](../language/tutorials/build_your_first_api.md) and [typed data processor](../language/tutorials/typed_data_processor.md) are executable 0.5 routes into web and serde authoring. They retain familiar module and model shapes while making errors, builds, and the native runtime explicit.

## Install once

Follow [Getting Started](../tooling/tutorials/getting_started.md) for the current installer choices and canonical first-project commands. If you already use Node tooling, the npm option installs command shims plus a host-specific release package; it does not make Incan a JavaScript runtime or TypeScript transpiler.

## What transfers

- Modules, async functions, collection transforms, JSON-shaped models, and service or CLI architecture
- Static application types as documentation and editor feedback
- Familiar package-manager ergonomics for installing the compiler command

## What changes

- Types participate in source checking and native compilation rather than being erased before execution.
- `Result`, `Option`, and `?` make ordinary failure paths explicit instead of relying on exceptions or rejected promises.
- Manifests, lockfiles, build reports, and generated-code inspection are compiler-owned project surfaces.
- The deployment artifact is native rather than a JavaScript bundle plus runtime.

## What not to expect

- A JavaScript runtime, TypeScript transpiler, npm package compatibility, or browser DOM APIs
- Structural typing to behave exactly like TypeScript
- Existing Node services to run unchanged
