# Beginner path

This page is a routing guide for new programmers or readers new to programming-with-types.

## Prerequisites

- Rust (1.85+): install via [rustup](https://rustup.rs/)
- `git` + `make`: for the canonical Getting Started workflow
- Recommended: [Editor setup](../tooling/how-to/editor_setup.md) (fast feedback while learning)

## What you should do next

- Install/build/run (make-first) and run your first file: [Getting Started](../tooling/tutorials/getting_started.md)
- Understand where builds go and what’s generated: [Projects today](../tooling/explanation/projects_today.md)
- If anything fails: [Troubleshooting](../tooling/how-to/troubleshooting.md)
- Follow the basics tutorial track: [The Incan Book (Basics)](../language/tutorials/book/index.md)
- Keep a glossary handy: [Glossary](../language/reference/glossary.md)
- Use tooling early (editor/LSP) to get fast feedback: [Editor setup](../tooling/how-to/editor_setup.md)

## Guardrails

- Don’t start with the generated reference; use it later as a lookup tool.
- Don’t start with RFCs; those are design records for contributors.
