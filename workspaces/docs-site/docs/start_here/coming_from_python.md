# Coming from Python (apps)

This route is for Python developers evaluating Incan for application code, services, typed domain packages, and deployment-oriented tools.

  <strong>Keep the readable application-code shape. Move more failure, type, and deployment facts into contracts the compiler can check.</strong>

## Build an application-shaped project

The [typed data processor](../language/tutorials/typed_data_processor.md) and [typed API](../language/tutorials/build_your_first_api.md) carry familiar model, JSON, file, and service shapes into native 0.5 projects. Their standard-library closures are part of the toolchain's full Loaf, so both tutorials finish with runtime evidence rather than source inspection alone.

## Install once

Follow [Getting Started](../tooling/tutorials/getting_started.md) for the current installer choices and canonical `new` → `run` → `test` → `build` loop. If you use Python tooling every day, the `pipx` option keeps the `incan` command isolated from project environments; it does not make Incan a Python package runtime.

## What transfers

- Readable functions, named arguments, modules, collections, comprehensions, and model-shaped application code
- Familiar function, module, and result composition for application work
- A small amount of syntax around an explicit, testable application core

## What changes

- `Result`, `Option`, and `?` make ordinary fallibility part of the function contract instead of an exception-only convention.
- Models and derives move validation and serialization behavior into compiler-visible types.
- The toolchain produces native binaries through Rust rather than executing source in CPython.
- A manifest and lockfile own project and dependency facts that Python tools often distribute across several files.

## What not to expect

- CPython compatibility, Python package compatibility, or the ability to import arbitrary PyPI packages
- Notebook or dataframe compatibility merely because the source syntax is familiar
- Dynamic monkey-patching as an application extension model

## Continue

- [The Incan Book](../language/tutorials/book/index.md) for a linear fundamentals route
- [Error handling](../language/explanation/error_handling.md) for the `Result` and `Option` model
- [Models and classes](../language/explanation/models_and_classes/index.md) for data and behavior types
- [Editor setup](../tooling/how-to/editor_setup.md) and [Troubleshooting](../tooling/how-to/troubleshooting.md) for the working loop
