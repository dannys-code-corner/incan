# RFC 015: Hatch-like Tooling (Project Lifecycle CLI)

**Status:** Planned  
**Created:** 2025-12-23  
**Author(s):** Danny Meijer (@danny-meijer)  
**Related:** RFC 013 (Rust crate dependencies), RFC 020 (Cargo offline/locked policy)

## Summary

Introduce a first-class, batteries-included project lifecycle CLI — similar in spirit to Python’s Hatch — for:

- **Versioning**: `incan version <major|minor|patch|alpha|beta|rc|dev>` (with optional `--dry-run`)
- **Project scaffolding**: `incan init` (in-place) and `incan new <name>` (new directory)
- **Environments**: `incan env ...` for repeatable, named command execution (CI-friendly) without implicit “magic”
- (future) **Matrix testing** (tox/nox-style): a follow-up RFC may add a matrix/env runner once RFC 019 stabilizes
- Additional “hatch-like” ergonomics where it fits Incan’s workflow (format/lint/release/build/publish).

This RFC defines the CLI surface, the project metadata format, and the implementation boundaries
so we don’t bake policy into ad-hoc scripts.

## Motivation

Incan is a compiler + runtime ecosystem, but day-to-day developer experience is heavily shaped by tooling:

- Starting a new project should be **one command**.
- Bumping versions should be **correct and consistent** across project metadata, derived artifacts, and any package metadata.
- Running tests should support **repeatable environments** and **matrix execution**, without forcing users to learn Cargo
  internals.
- Release workflows should be **scriptable** and **standard** across projects.

Python’s Hatch demonstrates that a single tool can cover the project lifecycle. This RFC adapts the useful parts to Incan.

## Goals

- Provide an ergonomic, consistent, and scriptable CLI for common workflows:
    - `init`, `new`, `version`, `test`, `env`
    - (future) `fmt`, `lint`, `build`, `publish`
- Define a single source of truth for project metadata (name, version, toolchain constraints, entrypoints, dependencies).
- Keep builds deterministic and reproducible (align with RFC 013 + RFC 020).
- Avoid “magic”: scaffolded project files are explicit and readable.

## Non-Goals

- Implement a public package registry client (publish/install) in this RFC (can be a follow-up RFC).
- Replace Cargo for Rust-level dependency resolution (we can orchestrate Cargo, not reinvent it).
- Provide virtualenv-style isolation identical to Python (we’ll use explicit env configs and reproducible commands instead).

## Terminology

- **Project**: An Incan repository containing Incan sources and metadata.
- **Environment**: A named configuration overlay for repeatable command execution (`cwd`, `env-vars`, scripts,
  dependency overlays).
- **Matrix**: Running an environment set across multiple dimensions (e.g., debug/release, features on/off).

## Project Metadata

Add `incan.toml` at repo root (similar to `pyproject.toml`), as the canonical metadata source.

### Minimal example (bin-style project)

```toml title="incan.toml"
[project]
name = "hello_incan"
version = "0.1.0"

# Entry points for project-aware execution (future: `incan run <script>`)
[project.scripts]
main = "src/main.incn"

[dependencies]
# Cargo/Rust crate dependencies for `rust::...` (RFC 013)
rand = "0.8"
serde = { version = "1.0", features = ["derive"] }
```

Notes:

- `[tool.incan]` may contain additional tool-specific configuration (e.g., formatter settings, test timeouts).
  These are defined by their respective RFCs (e.g., RFC 019 for test configuration) and are not specified here.
- `version` is SemVer-compatible with pre-release tags.
- Rust dependencies integrate with RFC 013 rules.
- `incan.toml` is the **project metadata** and is intended to be edited.
- Generated build artifacts under `target/` are readable for debugging, but are **not** intended for manual editing
  (RFC 020).

### `[project]` schema (normative)

The `[project]` table is the canonical, toolchain-owned metadata for an Incan project.

Required keys:

- **`name: str`**: the project name.
- **`version: str`**: the project version (SemVer; pre-release tags allowed).

Optional keys (all `str` unless noted):

- **`description`**: short human-readable description.
- **`authors: List[str]`**: list of author strings (recommended format: `"Name <email@example.com>"`).
- **`maintainers: List[str]`**: list of maintainer strings (same format as `authors`).
- **`license`**: SPDX license identifier or SPDX expression.
- **`license-files: List[str]`**: paths to license files (relative to project root; future-facing).
- **`readme`**: path to a readme file (relative to project root).
- **`homepage`**: project homepage URL.
- **`repository`**: source repository URL.
- **`documentation`**: documentation URL.
- **`issues`**: issue tracker URL.
- **`keywords: List[str]`**: keywords/tags (used for search/discovery; future-facing).
- **`classifiers: List[str]`**: trove-like classifiers (future-facing; useful for packaging/indexes).
- **`requires-incan`**: SemVer requirement for the minimum supported Incan toolchain version.
- **`private: bool`**: if true, the project must not be publishable (future: enforced by `incan publish`).

Validation rules:

- `name` must be non-empty and should be stable over the project’s lifetime.
    - Recommended (non-normative) name pattern: `^[a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9_-]*$`.
- `version` must be SemVer-compatible (including pre-release tags like `-alpha.1`).
- Paths like `readme` must be relative to project root (unless absolute); if present they must not escape the project root.
    - The same rule applies to `license-files` and `[project.scripts]` entrypoint paths.

Unknown keys:

- Unknown keys under `[project]` should produce a warning (to catch typos) and are validated by `incan check-config` (future).

Full example (metadata-rich):

```toml title="incan.toml"
[project]
name = "my_app"
version = "0.1.0-alpha.1"
description = "An example Incan application"
authors = ["Arthur Dent <arthur.dent@example.com>", "Tricia McMillan <trillian@example.com>"]
maintainers = ["Build Team <build-team@example.com>"]
license = "MIT"
readme = "README.md"
homepage = "https://example.com/my_app"
repository = "https://github.com/example/my_app"
documentation = "https://docs.example.com/my_app"
issues = "https://github.com/example/my_app/issues"
keywords = ["incan", "cli", "example"]

# Minimum Incan version required to build/test this project
requires-incan = ">=0.2.0"

[project.scripts]
main = "src/main.incn"

[dependencies]
reqwest = "0.12"
serde = { version = "1.0", features = ["derive"] }
tokio = { version = "1", features = ["rt-multi-thread", "macros"] }

# [tool.incan] may include formatter, test, or other tool-specific settings (see respective RFCs)
```

### `[project.scripts]` schema (normative)

`[project.scripts]` maps script names to Incan entrypoint files (paths relative to project root).

- Values are `str` paths to `.incn` files.
- A script name should be a simple identifier (recommended snake_case).
- `incan new --bin` must create a `main` script by default: `main = "src/main.incn"`.

This RFC does not define project-aware `incan run` behavior for scripts yet.
It only defines the configuration shape so it can be used by follow-up tooling RFCs without changing `incan.toml`.

Note: `[project.scripts]` maps script names to `.incn` entrypoint paths. This is distinct from
`[tool.incan.envs.<name>.scripts]` (defined below), which maps script names to shell command argv lists for env execution.

---

## Project root discovery (normative)

Most `incan` subcommands operate on a project.

Project root resolution:

- Starting from the current working directory, walk upward to find the nearest directory containing `incan.toml`.
- The first `incan.toml` found determines the project root.
- If no `incan.toml` is found, the command must fail with a clear diagnostic suggesting `incan init` or `incan new`.

Monorepos / nested projects:

- Nested `incan.toml` files are allowed; the nearest one wins.
- A future extension may add explicit workspace support; this RFC’s behavior is intentionally simple and deterministic.

Override:

- Commands may accept `--project <path>` to explicitly target a project root (path to a directory containing `incan.toml`).

### When `incan.toml` is required (normative)

`incan.toml` is **mandatory** for project-aware commands:

- `incan test`, `incan version`, `incan env ...`

`incan.toml` is **not required** for single-file execution:

- `incan run <file>` and `incan run -c "<code>"` work without a project context.
- In this mode, project-level features (dependencies, envs, versioning) are not available.
- If a single-file script needs Rust dependencies, it must use inline annotations (RFC 013) or be part of a project.

`incan build <file>` may operate in either mode:

- In **project mode**, project-level dependencies and strict lock semantics apply (RFC 013/020).
- In **single-file mode**, dependency configuration is limited to inline annotations and known-good defaults (RFC 013),
  and strict flags operate on the generated project’s `Cargo.lock` (RFC 020).

## CLI Design

### `incan new <name>`

Create a new directory containing a minimal Incan project scaffold:

- `incan.toml`
- `src/main.incn` (hello world)
- `README.md`
- `.gitignore`

The generated `incan.toml` must include:

- `[project]` with `name` and `version`
- `[project.scripts]` with `main = "src/main.incn"`

Reproducibility (normative):

- `incan new` creates a project with `incan.toml` at the project root.
- On the first `incan build` or `incan test`, the toolchain generates `incan.lock` at the project root (per RFC 013).
- Projects are recommended to commit `incan.lock` for reproducible builds (especially in CI).

Behavior:

- By default, `incan new` is **interactive**: it prompts for project metadata (description, author, license, etc.).
- Use `-y` / `--yes` to skip prompts and use defaults (non-interactive mode for scripting/CI).

Flags:

- `--bin` (default; creates `src/main.incn`)
- `--dir <path>` (default: `./<name>`)
- `--force` (overwrite existing directory)
- `-y` / `--yes` (non-interactive; use defaults without prompting)

Note: `--lib` is intentionally deferred until there is a packaging/distribution story for Incan libraries.

### `incan init`

Initialize `incan.toml` (and `src/main.incn`) in the current directory.

Behavior:

- By default, `incan init` is **interactive**: it prompts for project metadata.
- Use `-y` / `--yes` to skip prompts and use defaults (non-interactive mode for scripting/CI).

Flags:

- `--force` (overwrite existing metadata)
- `--detect` (attempt to infer: scripts/entrypoints, existing version strings, etc.)
- `-y` / `--yes` (non-interactive; use defaults without prompting)

### `incan version <bump>`

Update the project version in `incan.toml` and any derived files that must match.

Scope (normative):

- `incan version` updates the **project version** only.
- Updating the Incan compiler/toolchain crate versions is a maintainer workflow and out of scope for this RFC.

Bumps:

- `major`, `minor`, `patch`
- `alpha`, `beta`, `rc`, `dev`

Rules:

- `major/minor/patch` operate on the release core and clear pre-release unless `--keep-prerelease`.
- `alpha/beta/rc/dev`:
    - If no prerelease exists, append `-<tag>.1`
    - If same prerelease exists, increment numeric suffix
    - If different prerelease exists, switch tag and reset to `.1`

Flags:

- `--dry-run`
- `--set <version>` (explicit override)
- `--keep-prerelease`
- `-m` / `--message <msg>` (for future integration with changelog/commit tooling)

Output should print:

- old version
- new version
- modified files

### `incan test`

Default test runner entrypoint.

Behavior:

- `incan test` runs the Incan test runner as specified by RFC 019 (project-neutral behavior).
- Cargo policy flags (`--offline/--locked/--frozen`) must be propagated consistently to any Cargo subprocesses,
  as per RFC 020.

This RFC intentionally does **not** define repo-maintainer workflows for the Incan compiler repository (e.g. “run all
workspace Rust tests”); those are out of scope for user-facing tooling semantics.

Flags:

- The test runner’s flags and semantics are specified by RFC 019.

### `incan env`

`incan env` provides a small “task/env runner” layer for repeatable commands, without changing the semantics of core
commands like `incan test`.

Core command stability (normative):

- Core commands like `incan test` are **not configurable** via `incan.toml`. Configuration is applied only when the user
  explicitly uses `incan env run ...` or `incan env show ...`.

Core shape:

- `incan env list [--format text|json]` (list configured envs; outputs env names, one per line in text mode)
- `incan env show <env> [--format text|json]` (show the fully-resolved env after inheritance/merging)
- `incan env run <env> <script> [--dry-run] [-- <args...>]` (run a configured script in an env)

Configuration (normative):

```toml title="incan.toml"
[tool.incan.envs.default]
# The `default` env is included by other envs unless they set `detached = true`.
env-vars = { INCAN_NO_BANNER = "1" }

[tool.incan.envs.default.scripts]
test = ["incan", "test"]

[tool.incan.envs.unit]
# `default` is included implicitly for `unit` (unless `detached = true` is set).
env-vars = { INCAN_FANCY_ERRORS = "1" }

[tool.incan.envs.unit.scripts]
test = ["incan", "test"]

[tool.incan.envs.docs]
# Demonstrates env inheritance: `docs` includes `default` and also extends `unit`.
extends = ["unit"]
cwd = "workspaces/docs-site"

[tool.incan.envs.docs.scripts]
docs_build = ["python3", "-m", "mkdocs", "build", "-q"]
```

Normative behavior:

- `incan env list` must output all configured env names. In `text` mode, one env name per line. In `json` mode, a JSON
  array of env names.
- `incan env show <env>` must resolve env inheritance and merging using the same rules as `incan env run` and then print:
    - resolved overlay chain (base → default? → extends… → env)
    - resolved `cwd`
    - resolved `env-vars`
    - resolved scripts (and the final argv for each script)
    - resolved dependency overlays (base + env additions/overrides)
- `--format` controls output format; if omitted, `text` is used.
- `incan env run ...` executes the configured script **without** any further env selection/indirection. In particular,
  invoking `incan test` inside an env script must run the test runner directly and must not “re-enter” env resolution.
- Implementations must prevent accidental recursive self-invocation (e.g. an env script calling `incan env run ...` in a
  way that would re-resolve the same env). If recursion is detected, the command must fail with a clear diagnostic.
- `--` separates `incan env run` arguments from additional user arguments passed through to the underlying command.
- There are no implicit lifecycle hooks (e.g. no automatic `pre*`/`post*` script execution). Only the explicitly-invoked
  `<script>` is run.
- `--dry-run` must print the resolved command (`cwd`, `env-vars`, argv) and exit successfully without executing it.

Example (`--dry-run` output):

```bash
$ incan env run unit test --dry-run -- -k "addition"
env: unit
cwd: /home/user/my_project
env-vars:
  INCAN_NO_BANNER=1
  INCAN_FANCY_ERRORS=1
command: incan test -k addition
```

> Note: `env-vars` shows the merged result after inheritance — `INCAN_NO_BANNER` comes from `default`,
> `INCAN_FANCY_ERRORS` comes from `unit`.

Example:

```bash
# Run the "test" script in the "unit" env, passing "-k addition" to `incan test`
incan env run unit test -- -k "addition"
```

`env` (Environment) context:

- Environments may define:
    - **`extends`**: an optional list of other env names to include before this env (non-circular)
    - **`detached`**: if `true`, do not include the `default` env (defaults to `false`)
    - **`cwd`**: working directory to run scripts from (relative to project root unless absolute)
    - **`env-vars`**: environment variables injected into the process environment
    - **`scripts`**: a mapping of script name to argv (`List[str]`)
    - **additional Rust dependencies** to be merged into the project dependency set, using RFC 013 schema:
        - `[tool.incan.envs.<name>.dependencies]` (merged into `[dependencies]`)
        - `[tool.incan.envs.<name>.dev-dependencies]` (merged into `[dev-dependencies]`)

Environment inheritance (normative; Hatch-like):

- There is a special env named `default`. If it exists, it is included automatically for every other env **unless**
  `detached = true` is set for that env.
- An env may additionally declare `extends = ["env_a", "env_b", ...]`. These envs are included (in order) before the env
  itself.
- Duplicate inclusion is an error: if an env would appear more than once in the resolved overlay chain, `incan env show/run`
  must fail with a clear diagnostic. (Rationale: duplicates usually indicate a misconfigured graph and can create surprising
  override behavior.)
- Cycles are forbidden. If inheritance is circular, `incan env show/run` must fail with a clear diagnostic.
- Inheritance is a configuration overlay mechanism, not isolation: it does not create virtualenv-style sandboxes.
- All overlays are applied deterministically in this order:
  project base → `default` (if included) → extended envs (in order) → target env.
- Merge behavior for common env fields:
    - **scripts**: merged by name; later overlays override earlier ones on conflicts
    - **env-vars**: merged by key; later overlays override earlier ones on conflicts (unsetting is out of scope)
    - **cwd**: the last overlay that defines `cwd` wins

Dependency merge semantics:

- Dependencies are **additive** (no removals).
- If the same crate key is specified in both base and env dependencies at any point in the chain:
    - **Version/source**: the env entry **replaces** the base entry.
    - **Features**: the env entry's features are **unioned** with the base entry's features.
- It is an error for an env to define both canonical and alias dependency tables (same rule as RFC 013), applied within
  the env scope.
- Envs cannot **remove** base dependencies; they can only add or override.

## Additional Commands (future; non-normative)

These exist today in Makefiles across many repos, and this RFC leans toward **CLI-native** equivalents so projects do not
need Make as a dependency.

However, they are intentionally deferred: these commands should be specified in follow-up RFCs once the core semantics of
`incan test` (RFC 019) and policy propagation (RFC 020) are settled.

- `incan fmt` / `incan fmt --check`
- `incan lint` (clippy-like checks for compiler + emitted code)
- `incan smoke-test` (build + tests + examples + benchmark smoke-check, mirroring current repo conventions)
- `incan doctor` (environment diagnostics: toolchain version, cargo, PATH, permissions)
- `incan check-config` (validate `incan.toml` for correctness and conflicts; may be folded into `incan doctor`)
    - Example validations: required keys in `[project]`, path safety, env inheritance cycles, unknown keys/typos

Extensibility (future; non-normative):

- Cargo-style third-party subcommands may be supported (similar to `cargo-foo` → `cargo foo`):
  if `incan <cmd>` is not built-in, the CLI may attempt to execute `incan-<cmd>` from `PATH`.

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Metadata + scaffolding

- Add `incan.toml` parsing (serde + toml)
- Validate schema and provide clear diagnostics for missing/invalid keys (see `[project]` schema above)
- Implement project root discovery + `--project <path>` override
- Implement `incan new`, `incan init`
- Teach codegen/project generation to consult `incan.toml` when present

### Phase 2: Version command

- Implement SemVer parsing + bump logic
- Apply updates to `incan.toml`
- Optional: update any secondary manifests (only if this repo’s policy requires it)

### Phase 3: Env runner

- Implement `incan env list/show/run` with scripts, cwd/env-vars, env inheritance (`default`, `extends`), `--dry-run`,
  and additive dependency merge
- Implement recursion detection and clear diagnostics

### Phase 4: Polish + docs

- Add guide pages: `docs/tooling/project_lifecycle.md`
- Provide “new project” tutorial for Python users
- Add examples for `new/init/version/test/env` and project root discovery

## Alternatives Considered

- **Rely solely on Makefile targets**: simple but inconsistent across repos, hard to compose and introspect;
    also adds an extra tool dependency we don’t need.
- **Embed everything in Cargo**: good for Rust, but Incan’s source-of-truth isn’t Cargo.toml;
    also doesn’t cover project scaffolding or Incan-centric metadata.
- **Adopt an existing tool (justfile, cargo-make)**: helps execution but doesn’t solve metadata/version semantics.

## Open Questions

1. How do we want to represent "dev" versions (e.g., `-dev.1` vs `-dev+<sha>`)?

   **Recommendation:** support both forms:
   - `-dev.N` for sequential dev releases (e.g., `0.2.0-dev.1`, `0.2.0-dev.2`)
   - `-dev+<sha>` for build metadata in CI artifacts (SemVer allows `+` build metadata)

   The `.N` form is useful for manual dev releases; the `+<sha>` form is useful for CI-generated artifacts where
   the commit hash provides traceability.
