Incan is currently in **Beta**.

What this means for you:

- Things may change quickly (especially ergonomics and tooling).
- Some pages may be incomplete; prefer the canonical entrypoints (Start here, Tooling start here, Language start here).
- If the docs imply a feature exists but you can’t find it, treat it as either:
    - overpromise (docs should label as future), or
    - discoverability gap (docs should link better), or
    - product gap (feature not implemented yet).

Keep an eye on the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/incan-lang/incan/releases) for new releases and changes.
