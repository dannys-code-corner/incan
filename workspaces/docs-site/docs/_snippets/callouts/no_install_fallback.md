!!! note "No-install fallback"
    If you did not run `make install`, you can still run the `incan` binary directly:

    - from the repository root:

    ```bash
    ./target/release/incan ...
    ```

    - or via an absolute path (from anywhere):

    ```bash
    /absolute/path/to/incan run path/to/file.incn
    ```
