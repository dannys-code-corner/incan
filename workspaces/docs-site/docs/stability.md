# Stability policy

Incan is currently in **beta**. The goal is to be honest about what is stable, what is evolving, and how releases work.

## Versioning

We follow a SemVer-style model:

- **Minor versions** (`0.X`) may introduce new language/tooling features.
- **Patch versions** (`0.X.Y`) must not introduce new language features; patch releases are for bug fixes and polish.

## Docs “Since” semantics

Where the docs show a “Since” field, it tracks the **minor version line** (for example: `0.1`, `0.2`), not patch releases.

## Practical expectations (beta)

- Expect some surfaces to evolve as the language and toolchain stabilizes.
- If you are evaluating Incan, use the Start here paths and the CLI reference as the primary sources of truth.
