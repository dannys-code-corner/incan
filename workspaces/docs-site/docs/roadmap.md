# Incan Roadmap (Status-Focused)

This page tracks the implementation status and near-term planning (without being prescriptive about timelines).

Incan development is driven by RFCs (Request for Comments).

- An RFC captures a design proposal for a feature, including syntax, semantics, and implementation details.
- RFCs are not necessarily implemented in the order they are written.

See the [RFCs](RFCs/index.md) page for more information about RFCs.

## RFC status table

This table is autogenerated from the RFC files (it reads each RFC’s `**Status:** ...` line).

--8<-- "_snippets/tables/rfcs_index.md"

## Core Phases (overview)

- Core language + runtime
- Stdlib + tooling (fmt, test, LSP, VS Code extensions)
- Web backend (Axum)
- Frontend/WASM (UI, JSX, 3D)
- Rust interop

## Current Focus

- Language stability/feature freeze (core semantics + test surface):
    - [RFC 000] (core semantics) *Done*
    - [RFC 008] (const bindings) *Done*
    - Tests surface:
        - [RFC 001] (test fixtures) *In Progress*
        - [RFC 002] (parametrized tests) *Draft*
        - [RFC 004] (async fixtures) *Draft*
- Frontend/WASM ([RFC 003]): JSX wrapper, signals/runtime, wasm codegen, dev/prod tooling

## Ecosystem keystones (planned)

These are the cross-cutting capabilities that make Incan feel “capable” for real engineering work. This list is intentionally
kept high-level and status-oriented (RFCs will be added over time).

- Standard library contracts for real programs (HTTP, filesystem/paths, process, env, time, logging, config)
- Capability-based access model for IO/process/env/network (secure-by-default for tools)
- Interactive execution engine: `incan run -i` (expression-first) → eventual Jupyter/kernel interop → richer workspace UX
- Packaging/distribution story for tools and projects (reproducible builds, artifact creation)

## Status by Area (high-level)

- Core language: see RFC 000 / RFC 008
- Tooling (build/run/fmt/test): see the CLI docs and RFCs 001/002/004/007 for the planned testing surface
- Rust interop: see RFC 005 / RFC 013 and the [Rust Interop guide](language/how-to/rust_interop.md)
- Web: see [Web Framework guide](language/tutorials/web_framework.md) (stabilization ongoing)

## Upcoming (next)

- WASM/JSX parser & codegen
- UI runtime (signals/effects/components) + examples
- Test runner fixture execution (setup/teardown lifecycle)
- Dev server + prod build pipeline for WASM target
- Python-style generators (RFC 006) — `yield` + `Iterator[T]` → Rust `gen` blocks
- Inline tests (RFC 007) — `@test` in source files, Rust-style proximity

## Deferred / Later

The following items are intentionally deferred to later, and might be revisited in the future:

- SSR/SSG for frontend: Server-Side Rendering / Static Site Generation for the WASM/UI stack (render pages ahead of time
    or on the server, then hydrate).
- Desktop/mobile via wgpu: using the wgpu graphics stack to run Incan apps as native desktop/mobile apps (instead of
    browser-only).
- CRDT/collab features: real-time collaboration primitives (Conflict-free Replicated Data Types) for things like
    collaborative editing, shared state, etc.
