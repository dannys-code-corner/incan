# Release 0.1

This is the first published minor release line for Incan.

Incan is in **beta**: expect evolution as the language and toolchain stabilize. See the [Stability policy](../stability.md)
for what changes are allowed in minor vs patch releases.

## Highlights

- A complete docs site (Start here, Tooling, Language Guide, Reference), built with MkDocs
- A make-first developer workflow (`make install`, `make smoke-test`)
- A usable CLI surface: `incan build`, `incan run`, `incan fmt`, `incan test`
- A generated language reference to keep documentation and implementation aligned

## Getting started (recommended)

- Start at: [Language](../language/index.md) and [Tooling](../tooling/index.md)
- For “first steps” workflows, use the CLI and Make targets referenced there.

## Looking for contributors?

Incan is still early and we’d love help—whether that’s improving docs, fixing bugs, or implementing RFC-backed features.

- Start here: [Contributing](../contributing/index.md)
- Good places to start:
    - docs fixes and examples
    - compiler diagnostics and error messages
    - small stdlib improvements

## Added (user-facing)

- Docs site (Start here, Tooling, Language Guide, Reference)
- Core CLI workflow: build/run/format/test (`incan build`, `incan run`, `incan fmt`, `incan test`)

## Known limitations (0.1)

Incan is still evolving. A few things you may run into:

- Some compiler/language features described in RFCs may be partially implemented.
- Rust interop is available, but crate support is gated by a “known-good” list (see: [Rust interop](../language/how-to/rust_interop.md)).

## Breaking changes

- This is a `0.x` release line; minor releases may introduce new language/tooling features.
- Patch releases must not introduce new language features (see: [Stability policy](../stability.md)).

## RFCs implemented

- [RFC 000: Incan Core Language RFC (Phase 1)](../RFCs/done/000_core_rfc.md)
- [RFC 008: Const Bindings](../RFCs/done/008_const_bindings.md)
