# Incan Programming Language

Incan is a statically typed language for writing clear, high-level application code that compiles to native Rust.
It aims to feel lightweight and expressive while keeping the things that matter in large codebases explicit: types, errors, and mutability.

## Why Incan?

- **Readable by default**: concise syntax for modeling data and writing “glue code” without ceremony.
- **Explicit error handling**: `Result`, `Option`, and `?` keep failure paths visible and reviewable.
- **Strong domain types**: `newtype` and `model` make invariants and intent first-class.
- **Deterministic composition**: traits are for behavior contracts and predictable composition.
- **Rust interop when you need it**: call into Rust crates for ecosystems and performance-sensitive utilities.
- **Native performance**: the compiler emits Rust and builds a native binary.

## Who is this for?

- If you like the readability of Python but want stronger correctness tools and predictable performance, Incan is aimed at that workflow.
- If you like Rust but want a smaller surface syntax for everyday application code, Incan is built to stay close to Rust semantics while reducing boilerplate.

## Status

> **⚠️ Beta Software ⚠️**  
> Incan is in active development. The language, compiler, and APIs may still change, although we will try to keep it stable as much as possible.  
> Feedback and contributions are of course welcome!

## Quickstart (from this repo)

```bash
# Install the compiler to ~/.cargo/bin/incan
make install

# Run an example
incan run examples/simple/hello.incn
```

## A small example

```incan
enum AppError:
    InvalidInput(str)

type Email = newtype str:
    def from_str(v: str) -> Result[Email, AppError]:
        if "@" not in v:
            return Err(AppError.InvalidInput("missing @"))
        return Ok(Email(v.lower()))

@derive(Debug, Eq, Clone)
model User:
    id: int
    email: Email
    is_active: bool = true

trait Loggable:
    def log(self, msg: str) -> None:
        println(f"[{self.name}] {msg}")

class UserService with Loggable:
    name: str
    users: Dict[int, User]

    def create(mut self, email_str: str) -> Result[User, AppError]:
        email = Email.from_str(email_str)?
        user = User(id=len(self.users) + 1, email=email)
        self.users[user.id] = user
        self.log(f"created user {user.id}")
        return Ok(user)
```

## Performance

Incan compiles to Rust and then to a native binary. Runtime performance can be close to Rust for many workloads,
depending on current codegen and library behavior.
