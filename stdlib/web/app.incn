Web Application Framework

Provides a Flask/FastAPI-like API that compiles to Axum (Rust).

Example:
    from web import App, route, Response
    
    app = App()
    
    @route("/")
    async def index() -> Response:
        return Response.html("<h1>Hello!</h1>")
    
    def main():
        app.run(port=8080)

model App:

    Web application container.
    
    Routes are registered via the @route decorator on handler functions.
    The app collects all routes and builds an Axum Router at compile time.
    
    Example:
    ```incan
    app = App()
    
    @route("/health")
    async def health() -> Response:
        return Response.ok()
    
    def main():
        app.run(host="0.0.0.0", port=3000)
    ```
    """
    
    def run(self, host: str = "127.0.0.1", port: int = 8080) -> None:
        """
        Start the web server.
        
        Args:
            host: Bind address (default: "127.0.0.1")
            port: Port number (default: 8080)
        
        This method blocks until the server is shut down.
        Compiles to axum::serve() with Tokio runtime.
